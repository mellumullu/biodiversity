Biodiversity in National Parks

This project is part of my Codecademy portfolio, where I analyze biodiversity within National Parks. The analysis focuses on understanding the diversity of species and their conservation status across different parks. By examining two datasets, I aim to draw insights into how various species are distributed and how often they are observed in these protected areas.

Datasets
The analysis is based on two CSV files:

1. species_info.csv
This file provides detailed information about the species found in national parks:

- category: The classification of the species (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Reptile).
- scientific_name: The scientific name of each species.
- common_name: The common name of each species.
- conservation_status: The conservation status of each species (e.g., Endangered, Threatened, Species of Concern).
  
2. observations.csv
This file records the observation data of species in various national parks:

- scientific_name: The scientific name of each species.
- park_name: The name of the park where the species was observed.
- observations: The number of times each species was observed at the park.
  
Project Objectives

- Species Distribution: Analyze the distribution of species across different categories and their conservation statuses.
- Observation Patterns: Examine how frequently species are observed in various national parks.
- Conservation Insights: Identify any correlations between species' conservation status and their observed frequency in parks.
  
Tools and Technologies
- Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization to effectively communicate the findings.
- Jupyter Notebook: To document the analysis process in an interactive environment.
